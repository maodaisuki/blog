# /////////Exclude files from exporting////////
# You can tell Git not to export certain files or directories when generating an archive.
# If there is a subdirectory or file that you donâ€™t want to include in your archive file but that,
# you do want checked into your project, you can determine those files via the export-ignore attribute.

# .gitattributes export-ignore
# .gitignore     export-ignore
# .gitkeep       export-ignore
